produce any empty plots.\n\nSource: https://www.statology.org/facet_wrap-vs-facet_grid-in-r/"

The code chunk is as follows:\n\nstu_qqq_SG &lt;- stu_qqq %&gt;%\n  filter(CNT == \"SGP\")\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Saving the filtered data as a new file\nTo avoid rerunning the above steps every time we analyse the data or when loading the webpage, we will save the filtered SGP data as a new file and utilize this file for further analysis. The code chunk is as follows:\n\nwrite_rds(stu_qqq_SG,\n          \"data/stu_qqq_SG.rds\")\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Calling the file to check if it has been saved correctly\nThis step helps to ensure that the new file has been saved correctly - before running the code, clear objects from the Environment workspace and run the code chunk below to observe if the data “stu_qqq_SG” appears.\n\nstu_qqq_SG &lt;- \n  read_rds(\"data/stu_qqq_SG.rds\")"

## 1. About the Project

My project group [StormTroopers](https://vaastormtroopers.netlify.app/proposal/proposal) is working on the topic of climate change.

As a small, low-lying city-state, Singapore is vulnerable to the effects of climate change which has brought about more extreme weather patterns - rising sea levels, dry spells and intense rainfall which at times can lead to flash floods.

![](images/clipboard-939414320.png)

According to an [infographic](https://www.nccs.gov.sg/singapores-climate-action/impact-of-climate-change-in-singapore/) above by the National Climate Change Secretariat Singapore:

1.  Daily mean temperatures are projected to increase by 1.4 to 4.6 degrees celsius; and
2.  The contrast between the wet months (November to January) and dry months (February and June to September) is likely to be more pronounced.

In Jan 2024, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS) announced the [Third National Climate Change Study (V3)](https://www.mss-int.sg/v3-climate-projections) which provided potential scenarios of our future based on low, medium, and high global greenhouse gas emissions.

1.  Very hot days will become more frequent.
2.  Extreme daily rainfall is projected to intensify.
3.  The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise up to 1.15m by end century, and up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario.

It is important that we better understand how climate change has been affecting Singapore, by understanding the trends in our daily temperatures and rainfall over the years, and utilise historical data to forecast future climate data. It will provide guidance on whether and how Singapore will need to urgently develop ways to mitigate and adapt.

### 1.1 Issues to address

The scope I am in charge of is Confirmatory Data Analysis which seeks to address the following issues:

-   Are the changes in rainfall and temperature over the years statistically significant? 

-   Are there really certain months “drier” or “wetter”/ “hotter” or “cooler”?

-   Are there certain locations “drier” or “wetter”/ “hotter” or “cooler”?

## 2. The Data

For this take-home exercise and the project, data utilised is the historical climate data from [Metrological Service Singapore](http://www.weather.gov.sg/climate-historical-daily).

The team downloaded historical daily records from various weather stations across Singapore from 1980 to 2023 via API scrapping as a *daily_historical.csv* datafile, which was subsequently processed to *weather_data_imputed.rds.*

## 3. Set-up

### 3.1 Installing and loading the required libraries

The following code chunk is used to install the necessary R packages:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse,ggridges,ggrepel,ggthemes,ggstatsplot,ggsignif,hrbrthemes,patchwork,dplyr, gifski, gapminder,plotly,gganimate,ggiraph,magick,car)
```

### 3.2 Importing the Dataset

```{r}
weather_data <- read_rds("data/weather_data_imputed.rds")

glimpse(weather_data)

DT::datatable(weather_data)
```

As can be seen, there are a total of 1548 records across 6 variables:

-   station

-   tdate

-   mean_monthly_temperature

-   min_monthly_temperature

-   max_monthly_temperature

-   monthly_rainfalls

### 3.3 Data Cleaning

#### **3.3.1 Check for missing values**

```{r}
sum(is.na(weather_data))
```

#### **3.3.2 Ensuring alignment in time period of records across weather stations**

::: panel-tabset
## Starting Year

```{r}
weather_data_start <- weather_data %>% 
  group_by(station) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(lubridate::ymd(tdate))) %>%
  summarise(earliest_year = min(year))

weather_data_start
```

## Ending Year

```{r}
weather_data_end <- weather_data %>%
  group_by(station) %>%
  mutate(year=year(lubridate::ymd(tdate))) %>%
  summarise(latest_year = max(year))

weather_data_end
```
:::

The starting and ending year of weather data across all 13 weather stations is 2014 and 2023 respectively, no further steps are required to align the time period of the data.

#### **3.3.3 Detailed dataset - adding year and month columns - for ease of analysis**

For ease of analysis, the tdate in *weather_data* was further broken down into year and month and added as columns to *weather_data_detailed:*

```{r}
weather_data_detailed <- weather_data %>%
  mutate(year=year(lubridate::ymd(tdate))) %>%
  mutate(month=month(lubridate::ymd(tdate)))

glimpse(weather_data_detailed)
```

Saving it as a csv file for analysis:

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_csv(weather_data_detailed, "data/weather_data_detailed.csv")
```

## 4. Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)

## 4.1 CDA #1 - Are the changes in rainfall and temperature over the years statistically significant? 

The first CDA that I will address is whether changes in rainfall and temperature over the years are statistically significant

As the data ranges from 2014 to 2023, there are 10 years worth of data.

## 4.1.1 Rainfall

### 4.1.1.1 Historical rainfall over the years

```{r}
rainfall_data_year <- weather_data_detailed %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(yearly_rainfall = sum(monthly_rainfall))

rainfall_data_month <- weather_data_detailed %>%
  group_by(year,month) %>%
  summarise(monthly_rainfall = sum(monthly_rainfall))

DT::datatable(rainfall_data_year,class = "compact")
DT::datatable(rainfall_data_month,class = "compact")
```

Saving it as a csv file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_csv(rainfall_data_year, "data/rainfall_data_year.csv")
write_csv(rainfall_data_month, "data/rainfall_data_month.csv")
```

## Overview of rainfall over the years

```{r,fig.height=6}
p1 <- ggplot(rainfall_data_year,
             aes(y=yearly_rainfall,
                 x = year))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line() +
  labs(title="Rainfall from 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Rainfall volume (mm)",
       x = "Year") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks =seq(2014,2023,1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1),panel.spacing.y = unit(5,"lines"),legend.position = "none")

ggplotly(p1)
```

Over the years, the rainfall volume is generally observed to have increased. We need to examine if the differences are statistically different.

Before we do so**,** we will need to determine whether the rainfall for each year follows a normal or non-normal distribution and we visualise the distribution of rainfall using ridgeline plots, using the code chunk below.

### 4.1.1.2 Distribution of Rainfall within the year from 2014 to 2023

```{r,fig.width=30,fig.height=20}
p2 <- ggplot(rainfall_data_month, 
       aes(x = monthly_rainfall,
           y = as.factor(year), 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option="turbo")+
  theme_ridges(font_size = 25)+
  labs(title="Distribution of Monthly Rainfall from 2014 to 2023",
       y="Year",
       x="Rainfall Volume (mm)")

p2
```

### 4.1.1.3 Normality Test - Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test

-   **H~0~:** Sample distribution is normal

-   **H~1~:** Sample distribution is non-normal

We test whether the distribution of rainfall within the year from the period of 2014 to 2023 is normal. As the p-value for 2014 below is \> 0.05, we do not reject null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that the distribution of rainfall within the year from the period of 2014 to 2023 is non-normal.

```{r}
shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2014))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2015))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2016))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2017))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2018))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2019))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2020))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2021))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2022))$monthly_rainfall)

shapiro.test((rainfall_data_month %>%
  filter(year == 2023))$monthly_rainfall)
```

### 4.1.1.4 Equal Variance Assumption Test

-   **H~0~:** Groups (different years) have equal variances

-   **H~1~:** Groups (different years) have different variances

```{r}
leveneTest(monthly_rainfall ~ as.factor(year), data = rainfall_data_month)
```

-   From the above result, we can observe that p-value \> 0.05. We do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So the variance across the samples is equal at 0.05 significance level.

Given the above, a parametric test will be utilised:

## Median Rainfall per year

**The hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median rainfall per year across 10 years.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median rainfall per year across 10 years.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
p3 <- ggbetweenstats(
  data = rainfall_data_month,
  x = year, 
  y = monthly_rainfall,
  type = "p",
  pairwise.display = "significant",
  conf.level = 0.95,
  messages = FALSE,
  title="Distribution of Rainfall across 10 years (2014 to 2023)",
  ylab = "Rainfall volume (mm)",
  xlab = "Year",
  ggsignif.args = list(textsize = 5)
) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20), plot.title=element_text(size=20))

p3
```

::: panel-tabset
The plot above shows that the p-value of the test is 0.02 which is \< 0.05 and for which the null hypothesis will be rejected at alpha = 0.05. **There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median rainfall across the years from 2014 to 2023.**
:::

## 4.1.2 Temperature

### 4.1.2.1 Historical temperature over the years

```{r}
temp_year <- weather_data_detailed %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(median_mean_temp = median(mean_monthly_temperature),
            highest_max_temp = max(max_monthly_temperature),
            lowest_min_temp = min(min_monthly_temperature))

temp_month <- weather_data_detailed %>%
  group_by(year,month) %>%
  summarise(median_mean_temp = median(mean_monthly_temperature),
            highest_max_temp = max(max_monthly_temperature),
            lowest_min_temp = min(min_monthly_temperature))


DT::datatable(temp_year,class = "compact")
DT::datatable(temp_month,class = "compact")
```

Saving it as a csv file:

```{r}
#| eval: false
write_csv(temp_year, "data/temp_year.csv")
write_csv(temp_month, "data/temp_year.csv")
```

## Overview of temperature over the years

```{r,fig.width=6}
combined_data <- reshape2::melt(temp_year, id.vars = "year", variable.name = "temperature_type")

p4 <- ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = year, y = value, color = temperature_type)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Temperature Trends from 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Temperature (°C)",
       x = "Year",
       color="Temperature Type") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2014, 2023, 1)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("turquoise", "violetred2", "steelblue2"), 
                      labels = c("Mean", "Max", "Min")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))

p4 <- ggplotly(p4, tooltip="all",width = 800,height = 600) %>% 
  layout(width = 800, height = 600)

p4
```

Based on observation, it seems like median mean, highest max and lowest min temperature did not undergo significant changes over the years from 2014 to 2023.

### 4.1.2.2 Distribution of Temperature (Mean, Max and Min) from 2014 to 2023

Likewise, to determine whether the changes in the median mean, median maximum and median minimum temperatures are significant**,** we will need to determine whether the temperature data within each year follows a normal or non-normal distribution. We visualise the distribution using ridgeline plots, using the code chunks below.

::: panel-tabset
## Distribution of Mean Temperature

```{r,fig.width=30,fig.height=20}
p5 <- ggplot(temp_month, 
       aes(x = median_mean_temp, 
           y = as.factor(year), 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option="turbo")+
  theme_ridges(font_size = 25)+
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Year") +
  labs(title="Distribution of Mean Monthly Temperature from 2014 to 2023",
       y="Year",
       x="Temperature (°C)")

p5
```

## Distribution of Maximum Temperature

```{r,fig.width=30,fig.height=20}
p6 <- ggplot(temp_month, 
       aes(x = highest_max_temp, 
           y = as.factor(year), 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option="turbo")+
  theme_ridges(font_size = 25)+
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Year") +
  labs(title="Distribution of Highest Max Monthly Temperature from 2014 to 2023",
       y="Year",
       x="Temperature (°C)")

p6
```

## Distribution of Minimum Temperature

```{r,fig.width=30,fig.height=20}
p7 <- ggplot(temp_month, 
       aes(x = lowest_min_temp, 
           y = as.factor(year), 
           fill = 0.5 - abs(0.5-stat(ecdf)))) +
  stat_density_ridges(geom = "density_ridges_gradient", 
                      calc_ecdf = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = "Tail probability",
                       direction = -1,
                       option="turbo")+
  theme_ridges(font_size = 25)+
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Year") +
  labs(title="Distribution of Lowest Min Monthly Temperature from 2014 to 2023",
       y="Year",
       x="Temperature (°C)")

p7
```

From the plots above, it seems like the distribution of mean, highest maximum and lowest minimum temperature within each year is not normal.
:::

### 4.1.2.3 Normality Test - Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test

-   **H~0~:** Sample distribution is normal

-   **H~1~:** Sample distribution is non-normal

We test whether the distribution of mean, highest max and lowest min temperature within the years are normal:

::: panel-tabset
## Mean Temperature

```{r}
shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2014))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2015))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2016))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2017))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2018))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2019))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2020))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2021))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2022))$median_mean_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2023))$median_mean_temp)
```

As the p-values above are \> 0.05, we do not reject null hypothesis. There is insufficient evidence to indicate that the distribution of mean temperature within the years is non-normal.

## Highest Max Temperature

```{r}
shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2014))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2015))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2016))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2017))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2018))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2019))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2020))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2021))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2022))$highest_max_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2023))$highest_max_temp)
```

The p-values above are \> 0.05 except for year 2021.

## Lowest Min Temperature

```{r}
shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2014))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2015))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2016))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2017))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2018))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2019))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2020))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2022))$lowest_min_temp)

shapiro.test((temp_month %>%
  filter(year == 2023))$lowest_min_temp)
```

The p-values above are \> 0.05 except for year 2022.

### 4.1.2.4 Equal Variance Assumption Test

-   **H~0~:** Groups (different years) have equal variances

-   **H~1~:** Groups (different years) have different variances

::: panel-tabset
## Mean Temperature

```{r}
leveneTest(median_mean_temp ~ as.factor(year), data = temp_month)

```

## Highest Max Temperature

```{r}
leveneTest(highest_max_temp ~ as.factor(year), data = temp_month)

```

## Lowest Min Temperature

```{r}
leveneTest(lowest_min_temp ~ as.factor(year), data = temp_month)
```
:::

Based on the Levene Test, p-value of \< 0.05 was only observed for mean temperature while p-values of \> 0.05 were observed for highest max and lowest min temperatures. A p-value of \< 0.05 indicate that we can reject null hypothesis and that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the groups (different years) have different variances. The converse is said for p \> 0.05.

Taking in results from the normality test and Levene test, non-parametric tests will be used for the CDA of mean, highest max and lowest min temperatures as non-parametric tests.

::: panel-tabset
## Median Mean Temperature by year

**The hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median mean temperature of each year across 10 years.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median mean temperature of each year across 10 years.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}

The plot above shows that the p-value of the test is 0.29 which is \> 0.05, for which we do not reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05. **There is insufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the mean temperature across the years from 2014 to 2023.**

## Median Highest Max Temperature by year

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median highest max temperature of each year across 10 years.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median highest max temperature of each year across 10 years.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}

) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20),plot.title=element_text(size=20))

The plot above shows that the p-value of the test is 0.90 which is \> 0.05, for which we do not reject the null hypothesis at alpha = 0.05. **There is insufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the highest max temperature across the years from 2014 to 2023.**

## Median Lowest Min Temperature by year

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median lowest min temperature per year across 10 years.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median lowest min temperature per year across 10 years.*

## 4.2 CDA #2 - Are there really certain months “drier” or “wetter”/ “hotter” or “cooler”?

## 4.2.1 Rainfall

### 4.2.1.1 Rainfall across different months

```{r,fig.width=17,fig.height=15}
p11 <- ggplot(rainfall_data_month,
             aes(y=monthly_rainfall,
                 x = as.factor(month),
                 fill = as.factor(year))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  facet_wrap(~year, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title="Monthly rainfall each year from 2014 to 2023",
       y = "Rainfall volume (mm)",

  theme_minimal()+
  theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(10, "lines"))+
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Year")

ggplotly(p11)
```

From the above plots, in 2014 and 2015, it can be seen that rainfall volume is higher in the later months of the year however this is less obvious after 2016. Notably, in 2021, a higher volume of rainfall was seen in January as compared to December.

A cycle plot can also be used to visualise the monthly trend of rainfall over the years from 2014 to 2023:

### Cycle plot

```{r}
hline.data <- rainfall_data_month %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(avgvalue = mean(monthly_rainfall))
```

```{r}

To determine if there are certain months which are drier or wetter, we need to carry out statistical test to determine if there is a significant difference in the rainfall volume across months.

As data is aggregated at the monthly_rainfall level in the starting dataset *weather_data*, we will carry out the test below using non-parametric test however in the Shiny App, users will be given the flexibility to change the test type to parametric, robust or even bayes.

## Median Rainfall across months

**The hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median rainfall across months.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median rainfall across months.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
p13 <- ggbetweenstats(
  data = rainfall_data_month,
  x = month, 
  y = monthly_rainfall,
  type = "np",
  messages = FALSE,
  title="Distribution of Median Rainfall across months (2014 to 2023)",
  ylab = "Rainfall volume (mm)",
  xlab = "Month",
  ggsignif.args = list(textsize = 5)
) +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20), plot.title=element_text(size=20))
p13
```

The plot above shows p-values of pairwise test that have p-values \< 0.05 and for which the null hypothesis will be rejected at alpha = 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median rainfall across the months for:

-   February with November and December

-   August with November

**Overall, this indicates that the differences in median rainfall across months are statistically significant, with February being drier than November and December, and August being drier than November.**

## Mean temperature by month

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median mean temperature across months.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median mean temperature across months.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
p21 <- ggbetweenstats(data = temp_month,
                      x = month,
                      y = median_mean_temp,
                      type = "np",
                      pairwise.display = "signficant",
                      conf.level = 0.95,

```

The plot above shows p-values of pairwise test that have p-values \< 0.05 and for which the null hypothesis will be rejected at alpha = 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median mean temperature across the months for:

-   January and February with May to September and November

-   March with May to August

-   June, July and August with December

**Overall, this indicates that the differences in median mean temperature across months is generally statistically significant. This suggests that mean temperatures are higher during the middle months of the year.**

The plot above shows p-values of pairwise test that have p-values \< 0.05 and for which the null hypothesis will be rejected at alpha = 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median yearly mean temperature for stations:

-   Admiralty with Pasir Panjang and Tai Seng

-   Choa Chu Kang (South) and Clementi with Tai Seng

-   East Coast Parkway with Jurong (West) and Newton

-   Jurong (West) with Jurong Island, Pasir Panjang, Sentosa Island, Tai Seng and Tuas South

-   Jurong Island with Newton

-   Newton with Pasir Panjang, Sentosa Island, Tai Seng and Tuas South

**Overall, this indicates that the differences in median mean temperature across stations is generally statistically significant. This suggests that different regions of Singapore are hotter/cooler.**

## Median Maximum Temperature

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median maximum temperature across weather stations.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median maximum temperature across weather stations.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}
p31 <- ggbetweenstats(
  data = temp_stn,
  x = station, 
  y = highest_max_temp,
  type = "np",

        plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
        text = element_text(size = 15))
p31
```

The plot above shows p-values of pairwise test that have p-values \< 0.05 and for which the null hypothesis will be rejected at alpha = 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median yearly max temperature for stations:

-   Admiralty with East Coast Parkway, Pasir Panjang and Tai Seng

-   Changi with East Coast Parkway and Pasir Panjang

-   Choa Chu Kang (South) with East Coast Parkway, Jurong Island, Pasir Panjang, and Tai Seng

-   Clementi with East Coast Parkway, Jurong Island, Pasir Panjang, Tai Seng and Tuas South

-   East Coast Parkway with Jurong (West) and Newton

-   Jurong (West) with Pasir Panjang and Tai Seng

-   Jurong Island and Newton

-   Newton with Pasir Panjang and Tai Seng

**Overall, this indicates that the differences in median max temperature across stations is generally statistically significant. This suggests that different regions of Singapore are hotter/cooler.**

## Median Minimum Temperature

**The** **hypothesis is as follows:**

*H~0~: There is no difference between median minimum temperature across weather stations.*

*H~1~: There is a difference between median minimum temperature across weather stations.*

```{r,fig.width=12,fig.height=10}

        plot.title = element_text(size = 15),
        text = element_text(size = 15))
p32
```

The plot above shows p-values of pairwise test that have p-values \< 0.05 and for which the null hypothesis will be rejected at alpha = 0.05. There is sufficient evidence to indicate that there is a difference in the median yearly min temperature for stations:

-   Clementi with East Coast Parkway, Sentosa Island and Tuas South

-   East Coast Parkway with Jurong (West)

-   Jurong (West) with Sentosa Island and Tuas South

**Overall, this indicates that the differences in median yearly min temperature across stations is generally statistically significant. This suggests that different regions of Singapore are hotter/cooler.**
